## Requirements

If you wish to program the Arduino Due-compatible side of UDOO DUAL/QUAD from your Pc, Mac or Linux computer, just follow these easy steps to get started.
First of all, check that these requirements are met:
* A working SD Card with UDOO kernel running should be present on UDOO DUAL/QUAD.
* J18 jumper should be unplugged. This will allow the communication between your computer and the programming port of the SAM3X.

* The micro-USB cable should be plugged in the `CN6` micro-USB port.

* To make your external PC recognize the UDOO programming port as a COM or TTY you need to install the [CP210x USB to UART Bridge Driver](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx).
<br />
If all the requirements above are met, youâ€™re ready to start. What we will basically do is configure the standard Arduino-IDE in order to make it communicate to the Sam3x of UDOO DUAL/QUAD, which is the Arduino-compatible micro-controller.

## Install and configure the Arduino IDE

  Udoo QUAD/DUAL works ONLY with Arduino IDE version 1.6.5. Download it from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous">here!</a>
</div>

* From your computer go to the Arduino website and downlaod the 1.6.5 version of the IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous

* Select the OS you have in your computer and download the IDE then install it

* Open the IDE, go to File -> Preferences and add this link to Additional Boards Manager URLs: `https://udooboard.github.io/arduino-board-package/package_udoo_index.json` , then click Ok.

<br />
<br />

* Go to Tools -> Boards and open the Board Manager.

* Wait few seconds 'till the end of the "index download" then look for `UDOO QUAD/DUAL (Arduino Due) by UDOO Team` and install it.

<br />
<br />

* Now in Tools -> Boards you should see the `UDOO QUAD/DUAL (Arduino Due)`, if so Click on it.

* Select the right Tools -> Port of the UDOO QUAD/DUAL Arduino Due

<br />
<br />

* Done, now you're ready to use your UDOO QUAD/DUAL with the Arduino IDE installed on your Computer.

**N.B:** in order to get it working on Linux 64 bit you need compatibility packages:
$ sudo apt-get -y install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
